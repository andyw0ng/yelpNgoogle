# Restuarant Recommendation

Google Maps + Yelp

The combinations of Maps and Yelp where you get actual good recommendations for food and the accuracy of Google Maps.

Aims to Solve: what is missing in maps and yelp alone. Yelp does not have a great map or location system while maps doesn not have the power of yelp for recommendation. This web app aims to solve the two.

What I will be using:

API: Foursquare, Yelp(Maybe), Maps.

Tech: React(Maybe), Rails; HTML, CSS, .JS

This app will allow users to enter a type of restuarant or restuarant name like you would in yelp or maps respectively. Then return what you need. For type of restuarant: It will return pin points of restuarants (i.e Tea Shops => 5 pin points of restuarant near you or enter zip code). For restuarant name(i.e Go Go Curry => Returns point w/ Address). This is all with the Foursquare API. Then using the maps API, it will allow me to point it to the map. 

Will be done if possible and above is completed: Add the directions to your phone using Google's Direction API.
